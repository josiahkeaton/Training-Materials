	    \item SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed and marketed by Microsoft.
	
	    \item  As a database server, the primary function of the SQL Server is to store and retrieve data used by other applications.
	
     	\item  SQL Server is built on top of SQL, a standard programming language for interacting with the relational databases. 
     	
     	\item SQL server is tied to Transact-SQL, or T-SQL, the Microsoftâ€™s implementation of SQL that adds a set of proprietary programming constructs
     	
     	\item SQL Server consists of two main components:
     			\begin{enumerate}
     		
     		\item 	Database Engine
     		
     		\item 	SQLOS 
     		
     	\end{enumerate}

		\column{0.45\textwidth}
		
\textbf{Database Engine:}  The Database Engine consists of a relational engine that processes queries and a storage engine that manages database files, pages, pages, index, etc
The database objects such as stored procedures, views, and triggers are also created and executed by the Database Engine.

\textbf{SQLOS} : SQLOS provides many operating system services such as memory and I/O management. Other services include exception handling and synchronization services.
	


		
		
		\column{0.55\textwidth}

		
		\textbf{Relational Engine} : The Relational Engine(query processor) contains the components that determine the best way to execute a query.
		
		The relational engine requests data from the storage engine based on the input query and processed the results.
		
		Some tasks of the relational engine include querying processing, memory management, thread and task management, buffer management, and distributed query processing.
		
		\textbf{Storage Engine} : The storage engine is in charge of storage and retrieval of data from the storage systems such as disks and SAN.

	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item To interact with SQL Servers, you need to install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
		
		\item  The SQL Server Management Studio is a software for querying, designing, and managing SQL Server on your local computer or in the cloud. 
		
		\item It provides you with tools to configure, monitor, and administer SQL Server instances.
