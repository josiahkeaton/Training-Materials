\begin{itemize}[<default overlay specification>]
	\item<1-> A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw data as input and processes it with a set of instructions (a program) to produce the result as output. It was derived from the Latin word which means, "Compute" - Calculate.

    \item<1-> A claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in liquid nitrogen and dropped from a sufficient height would produce a triboluminescent spark. 
    
    \item<2-> This yearly event involves a crowd of observers, who try to spot the elusive spark.
    
    \item<3-> The title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous Millikan oil-drop experiment which measured $e$, the elemental unit of electrical charge.
